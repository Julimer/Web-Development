Feedback from classmate Jason CHEN:

1. Generally good and all pages share a common look and feel, but he prefers simple design. In the global stream and profile pages, there are some functions like the "share" and "how many people has viewed this post" which can be deleted.

2. The registration page design can be improved or united, it is better to get all the elements centered or left-aligned.

3. In the real implementation, scroll bars should be added.

4. The "return" icon in the registration page can be united with the "home" icon.

Feedback from friend Tom:

1. There is no need to have the "Add a new post function" in the Profile page (It is a mistake...). 

2. More information about the person can be provided in the Profile page such as age and place.

3. The "Log in" and "Sign up" buttons in the navigation bar of the Log in page can be replaced by just words, the page seems to have too many buttons.

4. Like the red and black design.

5. In the global stream page, the timeline design is good but it is a bit useless and make the page complicated. Better to use just time shown after the post content.
